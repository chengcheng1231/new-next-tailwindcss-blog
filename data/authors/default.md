In 2021, I decided to change my career path from a [Delta](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index) production planner to a front-end developer. Thus, I enrolled in the [Lidemy](https://bootcamp.lidemy.com/) program which is a bootcamp for people who would like to be softengineer. The reason I would like to change my career is that I was not passionate about my previous job and I wanted to explore what I really wanted to do. As my favorite YouTube channel [Torres Pit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsnZXdLOGBnezK--CiG7FZQ) said, `"Always exloring"`, I stepped out of my comfort zone. I am glad that I made this decision because I love the culture of software and characters of developers. 

This blog is a place for recording my reading note, learning thoughts and coding skills. I hope that I can help myself to improve my expression capability and also help others to learn something new.
